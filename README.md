A crash collage web project


Note that this is not a complete web design.


we have done this for learning purpose.

1)Make sure that all .css extension files should be in css folder.create css folder to do that.


2)create javascript folder and insert .js extension file in it.


3)create images folder and insert images.


if you don't want to do those three things just change the path of link as your wish.


If you are using xampp then you have to store those file in path xampp/htdocs which mean you have to insert those file in htdocs folder of xampp folder.
Go to xampp control panel and start apache and MYsql server.
Now goto browser and enter http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ ,this will open  localhost database of mysql and create database with utf8_general_ci collation named registation or simply change the database name from the server.php and create table of id,username,password and email.Enter localhost/yourfilename/index.php


If you are using other than xampp go to https://www.google.com/ and search where to insert those file to run in localhost.
